## About

Bracket Engineering was incorporated in 2020, and is currently a sole proprietorship
corporation.

Our branding and logos are inspired by quantum mechanics, wherein physical quantum
states are represented by bra-ket notation (introduced in 1939 by theoretical physicist Paul
Dirac) which in turn denotes a pair of mathematical objects. The first of these objects is a linear
map which takes a vector in a complex vector space to a complex number, and the second object
denotes the vector upon which the linear map operates. For a linear map *f* and an abstract vector
**v** then, the notation takes the form <*f*|**v**>.
