## About

Bracket Engineering was founded by Jonathan Thompson, a former startup CTO and senior 
software engineer with over 10 years of experience in high-velocity feature development 
and robust systems engineering. Jonathan holds an MS in Applied Mathematics and is 
currently sharpening his theoretical foundations through his work toward a PhD in 
Computational Mathematics from Stanford University.

## Open Source

We are big advocates for open-source technologies as a way to break out of the 
fundamental restrictions imposed by proprietary systems. We believe in universal access, 
open collaboration, and community involvement; wherever possible, we make financial 
contributions back to open-source projects that are used in deployments maintained by 
Bracket Engineering.
